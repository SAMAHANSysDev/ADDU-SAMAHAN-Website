It means building our pathways forward in allowing ourselves to take control of our shared direction by strengthening the culture of sui generis leadership that creates transformative change from our grassroot communities up to the global arena. It is here as a student government that is sensitive to the needs of its constituents and responsive to the emergent needs of a new world inside and outside the university. ",
