        "This year, the Samahan ng mga Mag-aaral ng Pamantasang Ateneo de Davao is here for a lot of things — it is here for a more visible student representation, it is here for a closer university community, it is here for a humanized form of leadership that is both mission- and people-oriented, and it is here for you. It means building our pathways forward in allowing ourselves to take control of our shared direction by strengthening the culture of sui generis leadership that creates transformative change from our grassroot communities up to the global arena. It is here as a student government that is sensitive to the needs of its constituents and responsive to the emergent needs of a new world inside and outside the university. ",
        secondParagraph:
        "In heeding the call of today, we welcome a new wave of stories, both of struggles and success, as we work for a SAMAHAN that is now student-centric in providing spaces for every individual to grow in one’s own craft, a SAMAHAN that is now agenda-driven in pursuing causes that provide meaning and impact within our respective communities, and a SAMAHAN that is now present-minded in the execution of its plans while remaining grounded by the limits of reality. Through this, we highlight the need to couple responsiveness with novelty that is innovative in shaping the visions of every Atenean.",
        thirdParagraph:
        "In the new world, let our leadership be known as one that takes up the challenge to respond to the signs of the times; let our leadership be present here and now. This is the SAMAHAN that we want to envision. This is the SAMAHAN that rises to the occasion."
