    "The Ateneo has borne witness to the many <em>stories</em> that shaped its meaningful history since its inception in 1948 â€” stories that lead us closer to the <em>experiences</em> that make us who we are, to the <em>people</em> who inspire us to continue moving forward, and to the <em>dreams</em> that drive us to brave challenges that come along the way. While our stories may be <em>individually diverse</em>, they all are collectively rooted in <em>one shared beginning</em>. ",
    "In revisiting our humble starting points, the <em>Simula 2022</em> of the Ateneo First Year Onboarding Program remains committed to welcome a new wave of learners who will kickstart their journey within the comforts of Ateneo. It envisions to provide excellent instruction in reviving the <em>vibrant University experience</em> through its <em>blended modality</em>, uphold <em>Ignatian values</em> through <em>integral human interaction</em>, and strengthen awareness about <em>Ateneo's academic and non-academic policies</em>. In doing so, we provide a friendly avenue not just for the incoming freshies to live their own stories, but also for all Ateneans to take a trip down the memory lane, and look back at the moments where their stories all began.",
    "As we enter a new school year with renewed hope for the journey that lies ahead, we open <em>new chapters of Ateneo stories</em> that are yet to be told.",
    "All stories start somewhere, and this is where your story begins.",
    "<em>Sa simulang babalikan, kuwento'y ating simulan.</em>"
