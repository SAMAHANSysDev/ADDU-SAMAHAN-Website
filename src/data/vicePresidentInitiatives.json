This also involves fathering concerned individuals who form that particular sector to draft the set of provisions for the Code (i.e., Moro student members or LGBTQ+ members). They shall have drafting and reading phases for the final approval. These community codes crafted through the OVP will be coordinated and proposed to the Office of the Student Affairs (OSA) to update the student handbook, which is one of the best avenues to protect the students of Ateneo."
