    "This year, the Samahan ng mga Mag-aaral ng Pamantasang Ateneo de Davao is here for a lot of things — it is here for a more visible student representation, it is here for a closer university community, it is here for a humanized form of leadership that is both mission- and people-oriented, and it is here for you. It means building our pathways forward in allowing ourselves to take control of our shared direction by strengthening the culture of sui generis leadership that creates transformative change from our grassroot communities up to the global arena. It is here as a student government that is sensitive to the needs of its constituents and responsive to the emergent needs of a new world inside and outside the university.",

    "It has been three years since the COVID-19 pandemic took us through a drastic paradigm shift — challenging our capacity and ideals in building a vibrant university community. However, together with the lessons learned and the difficulties conquered, we take these experiences in stride in fueling our hope of transitioning back to the life we used to own — back to the people and the purposes that drive us in our collective pursuit for a student government that is here and now.",
    "thirdP":
    "In the new world, let our leadership be known as one that takes up the challenge to respond to the signs of the times; let our leadership be present here and now. This is the SAMAHAN that we want to envision. This is the SAMAHAN that rises to the occasion."
